      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>There are some folks who like to read long biographies, and others who prefer a few short words to describe someone. For those who fall into the latter category, this is for you: <strong>Programmer. Explorer. Curious.</strong></p>

      <p>For the former, the following is yours:<br>
      As with all people, there is of certainly more to my story, but if I had only three words to choose it would be the aforementioned. Certainly the most important of those would be <em>"Curious."</em> Were it not for my lifelong curiousity, I would likely not be able to use the other two words in this anecdote. Curiousity drove me at a very young age to begin exploring the forests near my house. Later it drove me to explore mountains, and eventually to exploring rivers. Each of these paths provided great trials, greater rewards, and a bounty of learning. </p>

      <p>The same curiousity that pushed me into the outdoors also led me to programming. After spending a few years in tech sales at Best Buy and then Apple, along with twice as many years in the outdoor industry in sales, management, and content creation, I found my curiousity no longer satisfied. These fields had very finite amounts of knowledge to be discovered, and so I sought a field where I might be able to truly spend the rest of my career constantly learning, therefore constantly satiating my natural curiosity. Between research online, friends, and a small bit of experience, <span class="curious">all paths pointed towards programming.</span></p>
      
      <p>I began my journey towards a programming career by enrolling at Epicodus, where I started the C# and React course in January of 2022...</p>

    <h2>Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</h2>
    <p>Outside of programming I enjoy partaking in a wide variety of activities. I am a photographer & videographer, a hobby which developed into a passion leading to contributions to numerous outdoor focused YouTube channels over the years. I've both produced content for some and been featured as a guest on others. I am also a musician! I play the guitar, as well as the bass guitar, and and have recorded a full length studio album with a band. These days I self produce tracks at home for fun. I'm also a kayaker, fly fisher, and hunter. These three pursuits provide me with some balance and exercise, which is certainly needed after a long day in front of a computer screen! Finally, I'm an avid fan of classic literature; currently working my way through Franklin Library's "100 Greatest Books of All Time."</p>
